    <li value="•">In classical optics, light (EM-wave) is shaped using waveplates or lenses (for example to make devices such as microscopes/telescopes)</li>
    <li value="•">Beam shaping in traditional optical elements means changing an existing wavefront of light i.e. spatial amplitude / phase profile</li>

            Problem: 
        </p> 
        Thickness of optical elements > wavelength of incident light → not useful in compact integrated optical systems.

            Solution: 
        </p>
        With the development of nanofabrication technologies, flat, ultrathin optical components (metasurfaces) can manipulate the amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency or simultaneously multiple parameters of output light in ultrashort distances with subwavelength resolution by tailoring the scattering behaviour of consisted nanostructures</li>
    <li value="•">Metasurfaces are created by assembling arrays of miniature, anisotropic light scatterers (resonators such as optical antennas)</li>
    <li value="•">The spacing between antennas and their dimensions are much smaller than the wavelength → the metasurfaces, on account of Huygens principle, are able to mould optical wavefronts into arbitrary shapes with subwavelength resolution by introducing spatial variations in the optical response of the light scatterers.</li>
    <li value="•">

            Why is it cool to arbitrarily tailor the wavefront of an electromagnetic wave?

            Answer: 
        </p>
        there are many applications in transformation optics and integrated optics (Pick 2 or 3 examples)
