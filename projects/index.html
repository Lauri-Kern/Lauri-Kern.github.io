            <h3><a href="advanced-solid-state-physics.html"> Advanced Solid State Physics</a></h3>
            <p>The lecture series "Advacnced solid state physics" by Prof. Dr. Maier at LMU university in the winter semester 2020/2021 was a popular course in the physics master curiculum. I greatly appreciated the opportunity to work with scientists at the top of their fields to design and produce animation clips for project. </br> </br> <a href="https://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lehre/vorlesungen/wise_20_21/EM1_Advanced_Solid_State_Physics/index.html"><i>Link to Lecture Overview</i></a> </p>

            <h3><a href="research-internship.html"> Pattern Formation: Min-system</a></h3>
            <p>In the context of a research internship, I investigated certain aspects of the Min-system. This is a particularly interesting biological system in terms of studying nonlinear dynamics and pattern formation. Besides my research work, I also practiced to efficiently communicate complex relationships with fellow scientists. I learned to pay special attention to clean design in the academic texts I write as well as in the animations embedded in presentations.    </p>

            <h3><a href="dna.html"> Theoretical Biophysics Seminar</a></h3>
            <p>In this seminar series I studied the works of Castellana at. al. on spatial organization of bacterial transcription and translation. For my talk I carefully picked their most significant results and presented them with special attention to concise explanations aided by clean animations. The way the nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations are set up becomes very clear by explaining each term visually.</p>

            <p>As a dog enthusiast it was only natural to use a little pup as a muse for my experimentations with walk-cycles. Admittedly, the walk-cycle still needs some improvement to be as smooth as possible. I also got to experiment with masks and shadows to play around with a "fake" 3D look using only 2D layers.</p>

            <p>I am a huge fan of organisation and planning! Using my iPad on a daily baisis I decided to design my own interactive planner. The cool thing about the planner is that the links in the PDF file work like "buttons" in the GoodNote5 app, so I can navigate the planner most efficiently. Feel free to check out the full planner by downloading it yourself!</p>

            <p>After familiarizing myself with 3D modelling in Cinema4D I had a strong urge to bring my little cake buddy from the digital realm to the real world. This little project was so much fun since 3D modelling both digitally and physically gives me much joy. </p>
