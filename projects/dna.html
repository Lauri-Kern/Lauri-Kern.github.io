        <p>The blueprints for each protein are encoded on the DNA. To synthesize a protein, DNA is first transcribed to mRNA (grey wiggly bits), and then the mRNA is translated by ribosomes (pink blobs) to make a protein.</p>

        <p>In order to understand how to set up the reaction-diffusion equation, let's begin by looking at how to mathematically define "diffusion" in the system. Fist, we simplify the geometry by counting the number of ribosomes per unit volume and projecting that onto a 1D geometry. The diffusion of ribosomes can be described by a discrete change in density along the x-axis. </p>

        <p>Next, let's have a look at the different reactions in the system. Ribosomes can attach to the mRNA with a rate of k<sup>T</sup><sub>on</sub> and start translating. After some time they detach with a rate k<sup>T</sup><sub>off</sub>. It has been experimentally seen that some ribosomes attach to the mRNA but do not translate any proteins. This happens at a rate k<sup>B</sup><sub>on</sub>. These lazy ribosomes then detach after a while with a rate of k<sup>B</sup><sub>off</sub>. Another reaction that can happen is when the mRNA breaks up and both the translating and the lazy ribosomes are released. This happens with a rate Î².</p>

        <p>In the last clip we see the results from the numerical simulation of this model. It shows that the as the density of ribosomes on the mRNA increases, the further they are pushed away from the centre of the cell due to volume exclusion.</p>

        <p>The way the DNA in the nucleus is modelled is through a random walk on a grid. The entropic force of this DNA-spring pushed against the pressure created by the increasing volume of the mRNA. This back-and-forth between forces determines the size of the nucleus. The simulations produce an average nucleus that matches experimental measurements. </p>
